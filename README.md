### How to setup dev environment

- Have [Go](https://go.dev/) installed (Preferably [1.22.5](go.mod))

Install the dependencies

```sh
go mod download
```

And/or just run the project

```sh
go run cmd/main.go
```

### How to build

```sh
go build cmd/main.go -o pavus
```

However, running the command below should generate a more lightweight binary

```sh
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -ldflags='-w -s' cmd/main.go -o pavus
```
